# cosmic_sleuth

This is our CS539 project on determing sources of UHECRs.

Folders with our names indicated our workspace for doing work if we felt the need to track it on Git. It is not reflective of individual contribution of the project, as much work was also done NOT on the git, and took other forms such as Google colab or coming up with theory, math, expertise, generating data using the simulator, analyzing the results in different ways locally on a computer not on git or colab, and/or other ideas for implementation in our group meetings.

The notebooks Cosmic_Sleuth_preprocessing_experiments.ipynb and Cosmic_Sleuth_source_number_experiments.ipynb contain our code and all of our MANY results. 

Most explanations are found in final report document.
